# Horiseon-website-challenge
## This is the first challenge that we had to do and it was very challenging because of the way we had to work with existing code to clean it up and make it semantic. My biggest challenge was cleaning up the css beacause at first I didn't understand where to start until I looked at it closely and saw that many classes had the same properties so I decided to combine them to make the code more clean.
